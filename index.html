    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>I received my BA in Food Engineering and my MA with Thesis in Biochemistry Science and Technologies. The language of both programs was 100% English. I did my internship at Be≈üler Makarna ve Flour Factory and my internship at Gaziantep Chamber of Commerce. I worked as a production engineer at CANBIS GIDA Co.</p> 
    <p>I attended a certification program on Lean Manufacturing Techniques and Digital Transformation Applications at Gaziantep Chamber of Industry Model Factory. The training covered lean and kaizen modules such as 5S, VSM, SOP, TPM, OEE, SMED and FMEA, as well as topics such as Logistics and Supply Network.</p>  
    <p>I completed ISO 9001 Quality Management System Basic Training / Internal Audit Training, IS0 19011, ISO 14001, ISO 45001, ISO 22000 trainings at Istanbul University's Europass International Certified Integrated Quality Engineering / Management Certificate Program. I completed my military service.</p>
    <p>At this point I considered a career change. I became interested in software and website development. I have enrolled Programming program in Istanbul University. Also, I recently started Dr. Angela Yu's The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp and I'm still continuing. I'm a team player, I love research and learning, and I'm easy to get along with.</p>
